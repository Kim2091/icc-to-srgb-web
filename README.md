## icc-to-srgb-web

### Basic Description
This tool converts images from various color profiles to sRGB, making them more consistently viewable across different devices and browsers. This is also useful when processing images and not wanting deal with color profiles. Simply upload your images, and they'll be converted to the standard sRGB color space, which is widely supported by most displays and software. The converted images are saved as PNG files.

### Advanced Description
This tool leverages your browser's color management system to convert images from their embedded ICC color profiles to the sRGB color space. The conversion process uses the browser's native ICC profile interpretation and color transformation pipeline. When an image is drawn to an HTML canvas, the browser automatically performs color space transformation from the source ICC profile to the canvas's native sRGB color space.

Important technical considerations:
- Color accuracy depends on your browser's ICC profile support and color management implementation
- The conversion process may clip colors that fall outside the sRGB gamut
- Output images are saved as PNG files without an embedded color profile, as they are now in the standard sRGB color space
- Some complex ICC profiles or non-standard color spaces may not convert optimally
- The tool maintains the original image dimensions and pixel data structure, only transforming the color values
- Conversion is processed entirely client-side using the browser's native color management system

Best suited for:
- Converting images with standard ICC profiles to sRGB
- Preparing images for web display
- Batch processing multiple images
- Creating consistent color output across different devices

Not recommended for:
- Professional color management workflows requiring precise color accuracy
- Converting wide-gamut images where color fidelity is critical
- Images with complex or non-standard ICC profiles
